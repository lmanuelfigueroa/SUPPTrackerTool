# SUPPTrackerTool
I create this tool to facilitate a task at my job which required to cross reference names of student from an event and our program's roster so that students in the program can receive awards points. Average number of students would range from 20-40 students with a max of 400 students for bigger events. 
This tool takes two excel sheets, one containing the name of students that atttended event and excel of students in the program which will be updated and saved.  
Excel contails tools to update our roster but it required a repeat process of writing formulas and it required the excel sheets of events to be saved in the exel documents and I created this tool so that the program's roster didn't require the exel sheets of the events to be saved.
